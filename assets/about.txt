B09K is an artist-run space founded in 2022 in Changsha, China, and initiated by Ruidan Zou, Mengyu Sun, and Yue Yuan.

B09K operates as a hybrid platform consisting of three interconnected parts: a bookshop focusing on contemporary artist publications, an exhibition space for projects and events, and Lunar Practices, a billboard-based artistic intervention project.

We focus on contemporary artist publications from Europe and beyond, including artist’s books, artist writings, research projects, creative concepts, and theoretical approaches. These publications reflect how young artists think, work, and position their practices today.

We are interested in library studies and the construction of personal libraries, exploring how books are collected, organized, circulated, and activated as knowledge models and personal archives. At the same time, we examine how books function as social and imaginative platforms that bring readers into temporary communities. Through exhibitions, events, performances, and billboard practices, we translate books into expanded forms and contexts, exploring their possibilities beyond reading.
