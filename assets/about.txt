B09K was founded in 2022 in Changsha, China and is run by Ruidan Zou, Mengyu Sun and Yue Yuan.

We focus on contemporary artist publications in Europe, including artist writings, research projects, creative concepts, and theoretical approaches. These books reflect how young artists are thinking about their work today.

At the same time, we explore how books interact with readers as platforms for imagined communities. We use exhibitions, events and performances as processes to translate the book. We intend to use these forms of interaction as a way to explore the possibilities of books.
